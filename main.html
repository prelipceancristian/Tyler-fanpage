        Tyler Gregory Okonma (born March 6, 1991), better known as Tyler, the Creator, is an American rapper, musician, songwriter, producer, actor, and visual artist. He rose to prominence in the early 2010s as the co-founder and de facto leader of alternative hip hop group Odd Future, and has performed on and produced songs for nearly every Odd Future release.<br><br>

        Following a large contribution to Odd Future's early work, Tyler released his debut solo mixtape Bastard in 2009. After releasing his debut studio album Goblin via XL Recordings in April 2011, he signed a joint deal with RED Distribution and Sony Music Entertainment for himself and his label Odd Future Records. With his gritty, horrorcore-influenced earlier releases, Tyler was often criticized for his use of homophobic and misogynistic slurs in his lyrics. He released the albums Wolf (2013) and Cherry Bomb (2015), the latter of which was considered to be a contrast from his previous releases as he experimented with a more melody-focused and jazz-fused sound. His fourth album, Flower Boy (2017) was met with widespread acclaim. His fifth album, Igor (2019), was also acclaimed by critics, became Tyler's first number-one album on the Billboard 200, and won Best Rap Album at the 2020 Grammy Awards.<br><br>

                        Bastard is the debut mixtape by Tyler, the Creator. It was self-produced by him and was first self-released on December 25, 2009. Due to its free online release and lack of retail availability, Bastard is commonly considered a mixtape, although Tyler himself refers to the project as his debut album.

                        Igor is the fifth studio album of Tyler, the Creator. It was released on May 17, 2019, through A Boy is a Gun and distributed by Columbia Records.<br>

                        Produced entirely by Tyler himself, the album features guest appearances from Playboi Carti, Lil Uzi Vert, Solange, Kanye West, and Jerrod Carmichael. Proceeding the release of Flower Boy (2017), the album was primarily recorded in California, with recording sessions also being held in Lake Como, Italy, and Atlanta between 2017 and 2019.<br>

                        Music journalists have noted that Igor continues to build on the hip hop and neo soul sound established in Flower Boy, while also incorporating R&B and funk influences. Critics have noted the album's use of synthesizers and low-mixed vocals. Thematically, Igor follows a narrative of a love triangle between the titular character and his male love interest. The album employs the "Igor" literary archetype to explore themes associated with love, such as heartbreak, loss, and jealousy.<br>

        <h2 id="critical-acclaim">Critical acclaim</h2>
        Tyler, the Creator has recieved critcism for his unusual lyrics, especially due to so-called "homophobic" and "hate-inciting" lyrics, making him more of an "underground" artist. Many have considered Tyler a simple, angry rapper. However, with his album Wolf, his songs have taken a slight turn towards a more artistic and "emotional" approach. While the abbrasive style still dominated this album, the next releases have continued to improve in this direction.<br>
        While Cherry Bomb was considered a small fail by a large part of critics, Flower Boy really put Tyler on the scene as more than just a rapper, and more of an artist. Music critics have acclaimed this album as an amazing work of art with deep meaning, as Tyler took a more personal approach. If Bastard and Goblin were written from the perspective of an angsty and "evil" teenager (even a goblin), in Flower Boy he doesn't abstain from talking about more personal subjects, such as his personal life, his fear of being forgotten by fans, or his sexuality.<br>
        His latest album, Igor, has relied almost in its entirety on feelings and emotions, the album presenting the evolution of a failed relationship. Influenced by R&B and Soul, the album presents feelings on a whole other level, in a completely new style for Tyler. With excelent recieval from Critics and fans, Tyler was awarded a prestigious Grammy award in the urban album cathegory.

        Tyler has had a strong presence online ever since his debut days, being especially active on twitter and tumblr. In almost 10 years and with a rather large following, it shouldn't surprise anybody that he went viral more than a few times. While some of his tweets have been considered "too much", given his personality it shouldn't be unusual. To the left are some of his most well known tweets, which have transcended the Tyler, the Creator fanbase and joined the general pop culture.<br>
        While these days he isn't as active on tumblr or even twitter, he uses social media to give small insights on his work and his life. <br>
